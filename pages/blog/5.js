                    When taking your teaching to the next level, the use of open
                    ended questions can be a game-changer. These thought
                    provoking queries not only stimulate children, but also
                    foster deeper understanding and critical thinking. Despite
                    their undeniable benefits, many educators still find
                    themselves defaulting to closed questions that elicit simple
                    ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses. How can you ensure using open ended
                    questions and enrich the learning experiences for children?

                  <p>
                    Open questions invite children to embark on a journey of
                    exploration, investigation, and critical contemplation. The
                    aim is to encourage children to delve into their thoughts,
                    actions and to critically think about the world around them.
                    Giving answers that entail more than just a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’.
                    For children to effectively respond to open questions, it’s
                    imperative that they become accustomed to this type of
                    inquiry. As teachers, this necessitates patience and the
                    creation of a conducive environment that fosters deep
                    thinking.{" "}

                        to cultivate open questioning is by setting up engaging
                        learning provocations. When children are intrinsically
                        motivated to explore, they naturally embark on a journey
                        of play, experimentation, and adaptation. These actions
                        often occur organically, with minimal intervention.
                        These processes are crucial and lay the groundwork for
                        open questioning.

                        <i>Observation as a key: </i>Observation plays an
                        important role in the use of open questions. It provides
                        valuable insight into a child’s capabilities and paves
                        the way for guiding them to the next level of
                        understanding. By closely observing their actions and
                        thoughts, educators can tailor their questions to
                        stimulate deeper thinking.

                        <i>Asking open-ended questions: </i>Following
                        observations, it’s time to pose open-ended questions.
                        These inquiries are designed to encourage children to
                        create a more profound understanding of the topic at
                        hand. Some examples of open ended questions include ”Why
                        did you choose to change this?” “What do you predict
                        will happen next?” and “How do you think this works?”.
                        These questions encourage children to contemplate and
                        articulate their thoughts.

                  <p>
                    During classroom discussions, open ended questions continue
                    to have an important role. They act as catalysts for
                    uncovering and exploring the thoughts and ideas of the
                    children. To ensure you can dig beyond the surface, follow

                        questions ready to initiate children’s thinking about
                        the topic. Remain flexible to adapt your questions based
                        on the responses you receive. Sometimes a single
                        question can lead to unexpected avenues of exploration
                        that are word pursuing.

                        <i>Patience: </i>Encouraging children to think deeply
                        takes time. Allow them the space to formulate their
                        responses without rushing them or providing answers or
                        options. You’ll be amazed at the inventive theories and
                        insights they come up with when given the opportunity to

                        is essential. To harness the power of open questions,
                        approach each conversation with an open mind, fresh
                        perspective, and flexibility. Dare to let children take
                        the lead, listen attentively to their voices, and
                        respond accordingly.

                    The power of open-ended questions is a well known fact. It
                    can unlock the potential of children, fostering a deeper
                    understanding and critical thinking skills. By employing
                    these questions, educators can create an environment where
                    children are encouraged to explore, inquire and contemplate,
                    enriching their learning experiences. Step back, observe,
                    listen and let the children take the lead of your next
                    learning adventure. Watch your students embark on a journey
                    of deeper understanding and self-discovery.
